# Value Counter Burp Extension

## Description:
A tool to count the unique occurrences of a specified field in a response from Burp Suite.

## Usage:

- Right click on any HTTP response within Burp Suite.
- Select "Count Values" from the menu.
- Enter the field name you want to count occurrences for when prompted.

## Note:

This extension is as is, and since Jython is not so much fun I will likely not update this extension.
